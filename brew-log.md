### Pitch

A rich fruit mead featuring mashed blackberries infused with warming allspice and cloves, brightened with fresh lemon. Hot water infusion extracts maximum flavor from the spices before pouring over the fruit. Mangrove Jack's M05 mead yeast provides high attenuation for a drier, wine-like finish with deep berry character and aromatic spice notes.

### Stats

- **IBU**: 0
- **OG**: 1.085

- **2026-01-20**: Second nutrient addition (2g, 48h)
- **2026-01-21**: Third nutrient addition (2g, 72h). Mixing shows high activity, smell is a bit pungent
- **2026-01-25**: Fourth nutrient addition (2g, 1 week). Filtered through cheesecloth to remove fruit, but poured entire container through cloth instead of proper racking - result is less clear than it should be. Will rack again in a few days to clarify. SG 1.020 (~8.5% ABV so far)
- **2026-01-31**: FG 1.000 (~11.2% ABV), racked into 1L bottles for conditioning. Delicious, dry but not overly. Very cloudy - future batches should use bentonite early and filter during final racking
